<p>Example - My placement
<br>
What I didn't  do..</p>
<p class="ideas">
I did not make a seating plan as my CT told me she didn't feel a seating plan was a good idea with this group as they would likely talk to each other across the room and she would rather contain it to the back of the room where they would hopefully be less of a distractraction by whispering,
<br>
<br>
I didn't necessarily agree with this, but I figured she knew her students better than I did. So I just left it alone.
<br>
And as it turns out... she was right
