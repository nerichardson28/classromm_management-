<p>Example - My placement
<br>
What did I do?</p>
<p class="ideas">
Once I had a base for a relationship started with the psychology students it was then that I had a talk with them that being disruptive and silly during lessons was not ok and that there was a time and a place for them.
<br>
<br>
They actually responded rather well to this and their disruptions became fewer and fewer and it became quite the pleasant time whenever we had class.
