<p>Example - My placement
<br>
What did I do?</p>
<p class="ideas">
I also decided to incorporate group work into almost every one of my lessons I had with that group. 
<br>
- I made sure to split up the that group so that they were away from each other and working with different members of class
<br>
- The results I got from this were quite surprising as there was one particular boy, who barely said anything intelligent when sitting with his friends, actually lead the group discussions and had quite the intelligent and insightful asnwers
