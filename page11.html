<p>As I said before there is some work to do on my part for this to be successful</p>
<p class="ideas">
- Get to know my students and try to build a strong relationship with them
<br>
- This can done as easily as listening to what they are talking about during work time
<br>
- incorporating some of their interests into the lesson I am teaching
<br>
- And chatting with them before and after class. This can be about common interests like tv shows or just checking in with them to ask how their day is going, what's new etc.
