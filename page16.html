What did I do?</p>
<p class="ideas">
I also got to know the students in my psychology class.
<br>
I did this by chatting with them before class started about various things like their favorite tv shows, movies they saw etc., 
<br>
I also tested the waters by joking around with them myself. Some of them were kind of shocked that I was willing to joke around with them but after awhile, joking around with them became common place...
